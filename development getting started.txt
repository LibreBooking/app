A) Project:
    - Repository viewed @ http://phpscheduleit.svn.sourceforge.net/
    - Check out url @ https://phpscheduleit.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/phpscheduleit/development
    - To contribute and submit your code please contact "Nick Korbel" <nkorbel@gmail.com>

B) Requirements:
    - Web-server
    - PHP 5.2 or greater
    - MySQL x.x or greater

C) Getting the development branch running:

    1) Create and populate the database
	run schema.sql
	run data.sql
	run sample-data-utf8.sql (optional)

    2) Set configuration values
	update config.php with your local settings


D) Development branch technical information:

    1) Application structure
	/			All user facing pages
	/css			All css style sheets
	/Controls		All reusable page control objects
	/lib			All application supporting objects
        /Authorization		Login/registration/authorization
        /Common			Non-specific shared objects (localization, dates, smarty, etc)
        /Config			Configuration read/write
        /Database		Database access and abstractions
        /Domain			Domain specific entities, repositories, services, etc
        /Schedule		Non-domain schedule related objects
        /Server			Web server abstractions (sessions, cookies, etc)
	/Pages			Page binding and workflow logic
	/plugins		Contains subdirectories for each type of plugin
	/Presenters		Application logic, page population
	/scripts		All application related javascript files
	/tests			All unit tests
	/tpl			All Smarty page and control templates

	* Any code outside of these locations should be considered legacy and obsolete

    2) Design philosphies
	[page].php should
		- define ROOT_DIR
		- include /Pages/[page]Page.php
		- construct [page]Page and call PageLoad()

	Each page should have at least one corressponding template in /tpl
	Each page should have a corresponding class in /Pages
	Each Page class should have a corresponding presenter class in /Presenters

	Logically related code should be grouped in a directory with a "namespace.php" file, which requires all files in that directory

	All classes should have good unit test coverage (level of coverage is up to the developer)
