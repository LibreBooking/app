# Developer Documentation
## Working on the projekt
The develop branch contains the most current working code of the Project and should be considered beta.  
The master branch is the most current stable release of BookedScheduler.  
You can automatically keep your fork up to date with the [pull GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/pull). which will sync the master and develop branches for you.
Please commit bugfixes / features to a new branch prefixed `bugfix-`, `feature-` so they can be looked over, and pull requested to the develop branch and will eventually end up in a release on master.

## Design philosophy
The Model-View-Presenter (MVP) pattern is used to keep a clear separation between application logic and presentation logic.  
Page objects act as thin abstraction to the template engine and typically have no other logic.  
Presenter objects orchestrate interactions between underlying application logic objects and the page.  
This typically includes fetching and transforming data and minimal application logic.  

```
    [page].php should
        - define ROOT_DIR
        - include /Pages/[page]Page.php
        - construct [page]Page and call PageLoad()
```

- Each page should have at least one corresponding template in `/tpl`
- Each page should have a corresponding class in `/Pages`
- Each Page class should have a corresponding presenter class in `/Presenters`

Logically related code should be grouped in a directory with a "namespace.php" file, which requires all files in that directory.  
This simply makes it easier to include necessary file dependencies.

## User interface
[Smarty template engine](https://www.smarty.net/docsv2/en/language.basic.syntax.tpl) is used for all UI presentation. Page templates are located in `/tpl` and, by default, are cached to `/tpl_c`

## PHPUnit
All classes should have good unit test coverage. The level of coverage is up to the developer and should be done when the code is sufficiently complex.
Tests must all succeed for a final release.

## PHPDocumentor
use [phive](https://phar.io/) to install [phpDocumentor](https://phpdoc.org/) globally as not to not pollute the composer.json
you can customize the output by copyiing `/phpdoc.dist.xml` to `/phpdoc.xml` which now takes precedence and isn't tracked with git.
