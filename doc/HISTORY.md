Unfortunately the source code for Booked Scheduler is no longer being distributed and version 2.8.5 seems to have been the last open source release, see https://www.bookedscheduler.com/the-future-of-booked/ and https://sourceforge.net/projects/phpscheduleit/files/ "Booked Scheduler will become a ful SaaS offering on November 1, 2020. This open source project will be discontinued. "

This repo is a copy of the https://sourceforge.net/projects/phpscheduleit git repo, it also contains several branches where I'm hoping to fix bugs, add features, etc.

Sadly I don't have the time to dedicate myself to this project, but I'm hoping to at least fix whatever bug may appear, with the limited understanding of the source code that I have. If you can help, or better yet, do you want go on with this project please fork it and keep developing it. Forks, help, bug reports are all welcome.

UPDATE: The worst-case scenario seems to have occurred, the original repo is gone and all the releases are also gone. As such I've added the few releases that I had downloaded but as I didn’t know exactly to what commit/tag they were connect, the releases and the commits do not correspond.
