					<h4>Description of General System Functionality</h4>
					<p>phpScheduleIt was developed for reservation and resource management. This 
						includes a full user log in and registration system, user profile management, 
						the scheduling/reservation system, and numerous administration tools.</p>
					<p>The entire system was written using PHP by Nick Korbel. The system uses any PEAR 
						supported database to store and manage all user, resource and reservation 
						information. Because of the availability of PHP, this system will run on any 
						platform that meets the aforementioned necessary requirements.</p>
					<p>At the time of writing, the currently supported PEAR databases are: <em>dbase, 
							fbsql, interbase, informix, msql, mssql, mysql, oci8, odbc, pgsql </em>and<em> sybase</em>
						(DB style interfaces to LDAP servers and MS ADO (using COM) are also availed 
						from a separate package).</p>
					<p>The system is optimized for Internet Explorer 5.5 or greater, Netscape 6.x or 
						greater and Mozilla 1.0 or greater. Netscape 4.7 is <b>not</b> supported.</p>
					<p>Any questions or bug reports should be directed to Nick Korbel at <a href="mailto:lqqkout13@users.sourceforge.net">
							lqqkout13@users.sourceforge.net</a></p>
					<p>This project is in no way associated with <a href="http://www.php.net">PHP</a> or
						<a href="http://www.pear.php.net">PEAR</a>. The PHP license is included in the 
						lib/pear/ directory.</p>
					<h4>Requirements</h4>
					<p>- PHP 4.3 or higher (4.2.x is supported but not recommended)<br>
						- PEAR::DB (included with most versions of PHP)<br>
						- PEAR::DB supported database. Compatible databases can be <a href="http://www.pear.php.net/manual/en/package.database.db.intro-dsn.php">
							found here</a>. <a href="http://www.mysql.com"></a>
						<br>
						- End-users need IE5+ or Netscape 6.x+ (Netscape 4.7 or earlier is NOT 
						supported)</p>
					<h4>Installation</h4>
					<p><em>If you are installing on a remotely hosted server, please see <a href="install/remote_host_install.html">
								Instructions for Installing on a Remote Host</a></em></p>
					<p>The installation creates all the necessary database tables and inserts a default 
						schedule.</p>
					<p>Installation can be accomplished automatically by using the included setup 
						script or manually, by following the instructions below.</p>
					<p>Note: Many of these steps include syntax that may or may not be exclusive to 
						MySQL. Please consult your database manual for other database syntaxes.</p>
					<p>1) Verify that the PEAR DB package, a PEAR supported database (<a href="http://pear.php.net/package-info.php?pacid=46" target="_blank">view 
							currently supported databases</a>) and PHP version 4.2.0 or greater are 
						installed and properly configured on the destination server. If not, download 
						and install at least these versions.</p>
					<p>2) Copy all of the phpScheduleIt files provided into a desired web directory. 
						Remember this directory because we will need it in the next two steps.</p>
					<p>3) Rename config/config.new.php to config/config.php and edit the file to be sure it is correct for your web server 
						set up. Most importantly, make sure that the 'weburi', 'dbType', 'dbUser', 
						'dbPass' and 'dbName' settings are correct.</p>
					<p>4) Follow the proper set of instructions below for your type of setup. If you 
						are installing on a local machine, the automatic installation is advised.</p>
					<p>5) After the installation is complete, you must register a user with the email 
						address set for 'adminemail' in config.php. This will be your administrative 
						user.</p>
					<h5>Remote Installation -</h5>
					<p>If you are installing on a remote server, please follow the instructions in <em><a href="install/remote_host_install.html">
								Instructions for Installing on a Remote Host</a></em> before 
						proceeding. This short document will guide you through creating the database, 
						tables and database user needed for accessing the data used in phpScheduleIt.</p>
					<h5><strong>Automatic Installation -</strong></h5>
					<p>1) Simply run the install script by navigating your browser to 
						http://yourwebsite.com/path_to_phpscheduleit/install/. You will be asked for 
						your database password. Note that you do not need to log in as root, but the 
						user needs to have permission to create and drop databases.</p>
					<p>2) You will receive a confirmation or rejection notice about each command being 
						executed. If everything goes well, you will receive a final notice that the 
						installation was successful.</p>
					<p>3) DELETE THE 'INSTALL' DIRECTORY. This is a critical step. If the directory is 
						left, then anyone is open to destroy your newly created database.</p>
					<h5><strong>Manual Installation -</strong></h5>
					<p>1) File preparation: The defaults used in the manual installation will work 
						correctly, but it is a good idea to change these. If you plan on keeping the 
						defaults, you can skip this step.</p>
					<p>To change the database name, change the word 'phpScheduleIt' on line 163 in 
						setup.sql to your new database name. To change the database user name, change 
						the word 'schedule_user' on line 164 in setup.sql to your new database user 
						name. To change the user password, change the word 'password' on line 164 to 
						your new user password.</p>
					<p>2) The initial database must be set up. There is an included setup file for 
						this. To execute the setup file in mysql, navigate to the MySQL executable 
						directory (usually /usr/local/mysql/bin) and at the shell prompt type the 
						following:</p>
					<p>mysql -u root -p &lt; <b>%path to directory%</b>/install/setup.sql</p>
					<p>For example: <i>mysql -u root -p &lt; /www/htdocs/phpscheduleit/install/setup.sql</i></p>
					<p>You will be prompted to enter the root MySQL password at this point. This script 
						will create the schedule database, the schedule user/password combination and 
						grant specific privileges to that user.</p>
					<p>For syntax for other databases, please consult your manual.</p>
					<p>3) Verify the installation was successful by bringing up the MySQL Monitor 
						(typing <i><b>mysql</b></i> at the shell prompt). Please note that all commands 
						entered in the MySQL Monitor end with a semicolon. At the mysql prompt, type <i><b>show 
								databases;</b></i>. You will be informed that the database has been 
						changed.					</p>
					<p>If the database that you just created is listed, then the installation was 
						successful.</p>
					<p>Type <b><i>quit;</i></b> to exit the MySQL Monitor.</p>
					<p>4) Open the config.php file and immediately change the administrative login (<span class="code">$conf['app']['adminEmail']</span>) 
						from its default to a new desired login.</p>
					<p>5) If desired, change any other settings in the configuration file.</p>
					<p>6) DELETE THE 'INSTALL' DIRECTORY. This is a critical step. If the directory is 
						left, then anyone is open to destroy your newly created database.</p>
					<h5><strong>Multiple Database Setup -</strong></h5>
					<p>To set up the system to use multiple databases (for example sharing a login 
						table), first make sure that the tables that you want to use from a different 
						database are already running. Next, set up a new version of phpScheduleIt by 
						following either the Automatic or Manual Setup instructions above.</p>
					<p>Next, edit the config/config.php file. Find the 'pk_prefix' field and change it 
						to something that no other instance of the scheduler is using.</p>
					<p>Now, you will need to edit the lib/DBEngine.class.php file. This is where all 
						the database names to be used are defined. In the
						<span class="code">DBEngine()</span>
						function, find the line that starts with "<span class="code">$this-&gt;dbs
        = array (xxxx);</span>" For each additional database that you want to associate with this 
						version phpScheduleIt, add a comma and then the name of the database, in single 
						quotes. For example, to use 2 databases the line would look like this:					</p>
					<p class="code">$this-&gt;dbs = array ($GLOBALS['conf']['db']['dbName'], 
						'name_of_database2');</p>
					<p>Further down, find function
						<span class="code">define_tables()</span>. This is where the table/database 
						relationships are defined. For each table, assign a database that it comes 
						from. This can be done by counting, in order from 0, the number that the 
						database you want to associate a table to, and typing that between the brackets 
						on the same line as the table name. For example, to use the default database 
						for the login table, but 'name_of_database2' for the rest of the tables, your 
						code would look like this:</p>
					<pre class="code">$this-&gt;table_to_database = array (
   'login'	        =&gt; $this-&gt;dbs[0],
   'reservations'	=&gt; $this-&gt;dbs[1],
   'resources'    	=&gt; $this-&gt;dbs[1],
   'permission'		=&gt; $this-&gt;dbs[1]
 );</pre>
					<p>Be sure that you do not change the table names, only the number between the 
						brackets.</p>
					<h4>Upgrading From version 1.1.x</h4>
					<p><em>If you are installing on a remotely hosted server, please see <a href="install/remote_host_install.html">
								Instructions for Installing on a Remote Host</a></em></p>
					<p>Note: A new configuration file is used in this release. Config files from 
						earlier versions will not work. Please copy everything in config/config.new.php between the START COPY and END COPY comments. </p>
					<p>Please refer to the release notes in the install directory for any additional 
						information.</p>
					<h5><strong>Web&nbsp;Based&nbsp;Update</strong></h5>
					<p>1) Simply run the install script by navigating your browser to 
						http://yourwebsite.com/path_to_phpscheduleit/install/update/. You will be asked 
						for your database password. Note that you do not need to log in as root, but 
						the user needs to have permission to create and drop databases.</p>
					<p>2) You will receive a confirmation or rejection notice about each command being 
						executed. If everything goes well, you will receive a final notice that the 
						installation was successful.</p>
					<p>3) DELETE THE 'INSTALL' DIRECTORY. This is a critical step. If the directory is 
						left, then anyone is open to destroy your newly created database.</p>
					<h5><strong>Manual Update</strong></h5>
					<p>To execute the update file in MySQL, navigate to the MySQL executable directory 
						(usually /usr/local/mysql/bin) and at the shell prompt type the following:</p>
					<p>mysql -u root -p &lt; %path to directory%/install/update/update.sql</p>
					<p>For example: mysql -u root -p &lt; 
						/www/htdocs/phpscheduleit/install/update/update.sql</p>
					<p>You will be prompted to enter the root MySQL password at this point. This script 
						will update the database to the current schema.</p>
					<p>For syntax for other databases, please consult your manual.</p>
					<h4>Common Issues</h4>
					<p><strong>If you are using MySQL 4.1 and above</strong></p>
					<p>There is a known authentication issue with PHP and MySQL 4.1 and above. When you 
						are installing phpScheduleIt using MySQL 4.1+, please uncomment line 373 in 
						install.php (for automatic installation) or uncomment line 166 in setup.sql 
						(for manual installation). This will ensure that authentication works properly.</p>
					<p><strong>I get a message that says "Cannot find file 'DB.php"</strong></p>
					<p>Your environment either does not have PEAR installed or is not properly set up 
						to find the PEAR files. Please see the PEAR documentation 
						http://www.pear.php.net for instructions on installing PEAR. PEAR should be 
						included and installed with PHP version 4.2 or greater.</p>
					<p>Try setting the config.php 'safeMode' variable to 1. This will almost always 
						resolve the issue.</p>
					<p><strong>I get a message that says "Error connecting to database: DB Error: no such 
							database"</strong></p>
					<p>Most likely the variables are not set correctly in your config file. This is a 
						simple fix, please see the readme for how to take care of it.</p>
					<p>If that is not the issue, then it is possible the database was not set up. 
						Please verify that the phpscheduleit database exists.</p>
					<p><strong>I get a message that says "Warning: unable to create file 
							/var/log/phpscheduleitlog.txt"</strong></p>
					<p>Your server is not set up to allow PHP to create or write to files. This is 
						commonly a permissions issue and changing permissions for PHP or for the 
						directory that it is trying to write to usually works.</p>
					<h4>Getting Started</h4>
					<p>After the system has been successfully installed and set up, create an account 
						for the administrator. You can do this by navigating to the Login (index.php) 
						page and clicking the Register link. Be sure to enter the login exactly the 
						same as it appears in the config.php file's 'adminemail' setting.</p>
					<p>After the Administrator account has been registered, you need to add resources. 
						Also, as new users are added, you will need to manage their permissions to 
						allow them to reserve a resource.</p>
					<h4>Configuration File</h4>
					<h5>Application Settings</h5>
					<p>All of these settings apply to how the application functions.</p>
					<p class="variable">
					$conf['app']['weburi']
					<p>This is the full URL to the base directory of phpScheduleIt (where index.php 
						resides). For example, if you installed it in htdocs/phpscheduleit, the value 
						would be http://www.yoursite.com/phpscheduleit.</p>
					<p>Please do not include the trailing slash on this value</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['app']['adminEmail']</p>
					<p>This is the email address and login value for the administrator. phpScheduleIt 
						allows for just one administrative account. Set this value to whatever you want 
						to use as the administrative login and be sure to register an account with this 
						value. You cannot log into phpScheduleIt using this address unless you register 
						it.</p>
					<p>This email address will also be used as the 'from' address for all email contact 
						with the users.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['app']['defaultLanguage']</p>
					<p>
						The language code for the default language. This must be included in the 
						language list in langs.php and will be used as the default and if any 
						translations fail for another language. This language file MUST be in the /lang 
						directory.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['app']['safeMode']</p>
					<p>
						If your web server is running PHP in safe mode. Set this value to 1 if PHP is 
						running in safe mode or 0 if it is not.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['app']['timeFormat']</p>
					<p>This is the format to view the times in. A value of 12 means that dates and 
						times will be on the 12 hour clock (using am/pm). A value of 24 means that 
						dates and times will be on the 24 hour clock (no am/pm).</p>
					<p>Only 12 and 24 are accepted values.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['app']['calFirstDay'] = 0;</p>
					<p>This is the first day of the week for the small navigational calendars. This 
						must be a value between 0-6 (0 = Sunday, 6 = Saturday)</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['app']['techEmail']</p>
					<p>The email address of your technical support. This value will be used to direct 
						technical email and all bug reports. It is highly recommended to set this value 
						so that this technical person can help the user or report any questions to the 
						project homepage on SourceForge and improve phpScheduleIt.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['app']['ccEmail']</p>
					<p>This value should contain all email address to CC when a user clicks the 'Email 
						Admin' link. To specify multiple email addresses, separate them with commas.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['app']['emailAdmin']</p>
					<p>This setting toggles whether to send email notifications of reservation and 
						registration activity to administrator.</p>
					<p>The only values this can be are 0 (which means that email will not be sent) and 
						1 (which means that email will be sent).</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['app']['emailType']</p>
					<p>This defines how email communications should be sent. In most cases, leaving the 
						default value of 'mail' will work. The other options are 'smtp' for SMTP, 
						'sendmail' for sendmail, or 'qmail' for qmail MTA.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['app']['smtpHost']</p>
					<p>This defines the SMTP email host address. For example, smtp.email.com. You only 
						need to set this variable if emailType is SMTP.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['app']['smtpPort']</p>
					<p>This defines the SMTP port. This is only required if emailType is SMTP and the 
						default value should be fine.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['app']['sendmailPath']</p>
					<p>This defines the path to sendmail on your server. This only needs to be set if 
						the emailType is 'sendmail' and the default value of '/usr/sbin/sendmail' will 
						usually work.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['app']['qmailPath']</p>
					<p>
						This defines the path to qmail. This only needs to be set if the emailType is 
						'qmail' and the default value of '/var/qmail/bin/sendmail' will usually work.					</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['app']['defaultPassword']</p>
					<p>This value is the default password that is used when the administrator resets a 
						password for a user. This value is only used if the admin does not enter a new 
						password value when resetting a password for a user.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['app']['title']</p>
					<p>This is the title to use for the application. It will be used as the default 
						title for pages and as the 'From' field in all email contacts.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['app']['use_perms']</p>
					<p>This setting toggles whether to use permissions or not. Using permissions will 
						limit who can reserve resources. If permissions are on, only users who have 
						been given permission to use a resource can reserve it. If permissions are 
						turned off, anyone will be able to reserve any resource. Permission changes 
						will still be saved, but they will not become effective until permissions are 
						turned on through the config file.</p>
					<p>The only values this can be are 0 (which means that permissions will not be 
						used) and 1 (which means that permissions will be used).</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['app']['readOnlySummary']</p>
					<p>This value tells if the read only schedule (available to all users and guests) 
						should show the reservation summaries.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['app']['readOnlyDetails']</p>
					<p>This value tells if the read only schedule should allow visitors (registered and 
						non-registered users) to click on the reservation and see the reservation 
						details.</p>
					<p>Please note that this opens up a small security hole in that if this is set, the 
						login is not required to view reservations and the details are viewable to 
						potentionally anyone.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['app']['use_log']</p>
					<p>This toggles the activity logging on or off. Logging writes all activity 
						(registration, reservations, resource data) to a log file of your choice.</p>
					<p>The only values this can be are 0 (which means that logging will not be used) 
						and 1 (which means that logging will be used).</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['app']['logfile']</p>
					<p>This value is the directory and file name of the log file to use. If the file 
						does not exist, it will be created.</p>
					<p>Please specify this as /directory/filename.extension.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['app']['useLogonName']</p>
					<p>This value tells if we should use a logon name for authentication instead of 
						using the email address. Set this to 1 to use a logon name, 0 to use email 
						address.</p>
					<p>Notes: A unique email address will still be required. Also, if LDAP is being 
						used for authenticaion, this will have no effect.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['app']['minPasswordLength']</p>
					<p>This is the minimum password length that is required for users registering or 
						changing their password. It is recommended that this be at least 6.</p>
					<h5>Database Settings</h5>
					<p>All of these settings determine the database setup.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['db']['dbType']</p>
					<p>This is the database backend type. This must be a valid PEAR::DB setting.</p>
					<p>The options are:<br>
						mysql -&gt; MySQL<br>
						pgsql -&gt; PostgreSQL<br>
						ibase -&gt; InterBase<br>
						msql -&gt; Mini SQL<br>
						mssql -&gt; Microsoft SQL Server<br>
						oci8 -&gt; Oracle 7/8/8i<br>
						odbc -&gt; ODBC (Open Database Connectivity)<br>
						sybase -&gt; SyBase<br>
						ifx -&gt; Informix<br>
						fbsql -&gt; FrontBase</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['db']['dbUser']</p>
					<p>This value is the database user who has permission to create, alter, modify and 
						delete data from the tables phpScheduleIt uses. This value is required to 
						access the tables.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['db']['dbPass']</p>
					<p>This value is the password for the database user specified in 
						$conf['db']['dbUser']. This value is required to access the tables.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['db']['dbName']</p>
					<p>This is the name of the database to be used by phpScheduleIt for storing all 
						system data. The user specified in $conf['db']['dbUser'] will be given 
						permission to use all tables in this database.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['db']['hostSpec']</p>
					<p>This is the host setting for your database server. In most cases 'localhost' 
						will work. Some servers require you to use the loopback address.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['db']['drop_old']</p>
					<p>This value toggles whether the automatic installation should overwrite any 
						databases with the same name as $conf['db']['dbName']. Please be very sure 
						about this setting. If you are in doubt, leave it set to 0.</p>
					<p>The only values this can be are 0 (which means that an existing database with 
						the same name will not be overwritten) and 1 (which means that the 
						aforementioned database will be overwritten).</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['db']['pk_prefix']</p>
					<p>This value is the prefix that will be prepended to all primary keys in this 
						database. This is required if you will be sharing databases between multiple 
						versions of phpScheduleIt (for example, sharing a login data but having a 
						different resource data).</p>
					<p>This setting <strong>must be different</strong> for every instance of 
						phpScheduleIt that is sharing the same database. 3 characters are recommended. 
						Anything over 3 characters will be cut down to use only the first 3.</p>
					<h5>User Interface Settings</h5>
					<p>All of these settings change how the application looks and feels.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['ui']['logoImage']</p>
					<p>This value is the directory and filename of the image to use as the logo. Leave 
						this empty if you do not want to use an image.</p>
					<p>Please specify this as directory/filename.extension. This will be relative to 
						the root directory of phpScheduleIt</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['ui']['welcome']</p>
					<p>This is the welcome message to show at the login screen. Leave this value blank 
						to display no message.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['ui']['my_res']</p>
					<p>This is the array that stores the color of the reservation block of all 
						reservations that the current user owns. 'color' defines the standard color of 
						the block, 'hover' defines the color when the mouse is over the reservation 
						block, 'text' defines the color of the text printed on the reservation. Please 
						do not include the hash mark (#) when specifying the colors.</p>
					<p>To set the colors, add or alter this line.</p>
					<p class="code">$conf['ui']['my_res'][] = array ('color' =&gt; '5E7FB1', 'hover' 
						=&gt; '799DD3', 'text' =&gt; 'FFFFFF');</p>
					<p><span class="variable">$conf['ui']['other_res']</span><br>
						This is the array that stores the color of the reservation block of all 
						reservations that the current user does not own. 'color' defines the standard 
						color of the block, 'hover' defines the color when the mouse is over the 
						reservation block, 'text' defines the color of the text printed on the 
						reservation. Please do not include the hash mark (#) when specifying the 
						colors.</p>
					<p>To set the colors, add or alter this line.</p>
					<p class="code">$conf['ui']['other_res'][] = array ('color' =&gt; 'D2DDEC', 'hover' 
						=&gt; 'AFBED3', 'text' =&gt; 'FFFFFF');</p>
					<p><span class="variable">$conf['ui']['my_past_res']</span><br>
						This is the array that stores the color of the reservation block of all 
						reservations that the current user owns, but have past. 'color' defines the 
						standard color of the block, 'hover' defines the color when the mouse is over 
						the reservation block, 'text' defines the color of the text printed on the 
						reservation. Please do not include the hash mark (#) when specifying the 
						colors.</p>
					<p>Please refer to the two variables above this for how to set it properly.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['ui']['other_past_res']</p>
					<p>This is the array that stores the color of the reservation block of all 
						reservations that the current user does not own, but have past. 'color' defines 
						the standard color of the block, 'hover' defines the color when the mouse is 
						over the reservation block, 'text' defines the color of the text printed on the 
						reservation. Please do not include the hash mark (#) when specifying the 
						colors.</p>
					<p>Please refer to the two variables above this for how to set it properly.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['ui']['positions']</p>
					<p>This is the available choices to use when a new user is registering for 
						phpScheduleIt. If you add values to this variable, they will appear in a pull 
						down menu. If you do not add values then the position field will be a text box 
						instead of a pull down menu.</p>
					<p>To add positions to the pull down menu, add the following line.</p>
					<p class="code">$conf['ui']['positions'][] = "Position Value";</p>
					<p>To add more positions, repeat the above line for each position. They will be 
						displayed in the order you list them. The value cannot be more than 255 
						characters.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['ui']['institutions']</p>
					<p>This is the available choices to use when a new user is registering for 
						phpScheduleIt. If you add values to this variable, they will appear in a pull 
						down menu. If you do not add values then the institution field will be a text 
						box instead of a pull down menu.</p>
					<p>To add positions to the pull down menu, add the following line.</p>
					<p class="code">$conf['ui']['institutions'][] = "Institution Value";</p>
					<p>To add more institutions, repeat the above line for each position. They will be 
						displayed in the order you list them. The value cannot be more than 100 
						characters.</p>
					<h5>LDAP Settings</h5>
					<p class="variable">$conf['ldap']['authentication']</p>
					<p>This sets whether you want to use LDAP authentication or not. The only 
						acceptable values are true and false.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['ldap']['host']</p>
					<p>This is your LDAP server's host name. For example,
						<span class="code">ldap.example.com</span></p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['ldap']['port']</p>
					<p>This is the port that your need to connect to your LDAP server on, usually
						<span class="code">389</span>.</p>
					<p class="variable">$conf['ldap']['basedn']</p>
					<p>LDAP people search base. Set this to where people in your organization are 
						stored in LDAP, typically
						<span class="code">ou=people,o=domain.com</span>.</p>
					<h4>System Navigation</h4>
					<p>Entry into the phpScheduleIt system defaults to the login screen. Here a user 
						can log in or navigate to the registration page. If a user has selected the 
						"Keep Me Logged In" option, then they will be automatically forwarded to My 
						Control Panel each time they return to the system (until they manually Log 
						Out). After a successful login or registration, the user will be automatically 
						forwarded to My Control Panel.</p>
					<p>My Control Panel is the "Home Page" for each user. They will be able to view, 
						modify and delete their upcoming reservations. The list of reservations is 
						sortable in ascending/descending order based on column name. Here, they will 
						also be presented with a Quick Links table where they can navigate to the 
						scheduler, edit their profile/password or log out of the system. Users can 
						return to My Control Panel from anywhere in the system at any time by clicking 
						the "My Control Panel" underneath the welcome message.</p>
					<p>The scheduler is where users book new reservations and edit past ones. Clicking 
						on a resource's name will bring up a pop-up window where the user can reserve 
						the resource. If the user selects a time which is already reserved by another 
						user, the reservation will fail and they will be prompted to try again. Users 
						CANNOT edit or delete another user's reservation. They will only be allowed to 
						view it. Also, users cannot book or modify a reservation for a past date, an 
						inactive resource or a resource that they have not been given permission to 
						reserve. The administrator has the power to modify or delete any reservation in 
						the system from both the scheduler and from the admin tool "Manage 
						Reservations".</p>
					<p>When a user clicks the Quick Link "Edit My Profile Information/Password", they 
						will be brought to a page resembling the Registration page with all of their 
						information filled in (except the password). Editing the information will 
						result in a change in the database. Blank or unchanged fields will not be 
						altered in the database.</p>
					<h4>User Management</h4>
					<p><i>Warnings:</i></p>
					<p>When using more that one instance of phpScheduleIt are sharing a database, it is 
						critical that all data integrity issues are addressed. For example, sharing a 
						login table but using independent reservation/resource/training tables can 
						result in compromised data integrity. If a user has reservations committed on 
						more than one system and they are deleted from the global login table, their 
						reservations will not be removed unless they are deleted from one of the 
						secondary instances of the system.</p>
					<p>There are two main techniques that can be used to resolve this issue:</p>
					<p>1) The shared data (in this case, the login information) must be removed from a 
						secondary instance of the application. This secondary instance will be aware of 
						all databases in the system and will be able to remove all data associated with 
						the data being deleted.</p>
					<p>2) The "leftover" data can be manually deleted from the system by an 
						Administrator. In this example, reservations associated with deleted users can 
						be deleted from the scheduler or from the admin tools.</p>
					<p><i>Notes:</i></p>
					<p>The initial <i>login</i> table will be empty.</p>
					<p>All users are required to register upon first use of phpScheduleIt. All fields 
						in the Registration form are required. Registration will fail if the form is 
						not completed entirely. Upon successful registration, a unique memberid will be 
						automatically created for each user.</p>
					<p>Users can edit their personal information at any time by logging in and 
						selecting the "Edit My Profile Information/Password" option in the Quick Links 
						table. They will be taken to their personal information page where any of the 
						fields can be changed.</p>
					<p><i>Administrative Tool : Manage Users</i></p>
					<p>The administrator can delete users at any time from the system by selecting the 
						"Manage Users" option in the Quick Links table. The "Manage Users" tool will 
						navigate to a page listing all users, sorted alphabetically (by default), 
						showing a specific number of users at a time. The list of users can be sorted 
						by ascending/descending order by column name. For each column, clicking on the 
						minus sign sorts the list in descending order based on that column name, 
						clicking on the plus sign sorts the list in ascending order based on that 
						column name. The sorting order will be preserved throughout pages.</p>
					<p>From this table, you can email a user by clicking their email address, view all 
						information about this user by clicking the View Info link, manage that user's 
						training by clicking the Training link, or delete any number of users by 
						checking their delete box.</p>
					<p>Clicking a users name link for a user will bring up a new window listing all 
						information about the selected user.</p>
					<p>Clicking the Reset password link will bring you to a screen that allows you to 
						reset a password for a user. This should rarely have to be done, because users 
						have the power to get a new password if one is forgotten. This function resets 
						the users password to the specified value or to the default value set in the 
						config file if no value is given on the reset form. No confirmation email will 
						be sent, so please notify the user after resetting their password.</p>
					<p>Clicking the Permissions link will navigate to a new window where you can select 
						which resources a user has or has not been given permission to use. Upon 
						registration, will only have permission to use resources if auto-assign has 
						been turned on in the config file. To grant or revoke permission for a user, 
						check or uncheck the checkbox for each resource the user is allowed to use.</p>
					<p>
						To delete a user, simply check the "Delete User" box for each user who the 
						administrator wishes to remove and press the "Delete Users" button. The 
						administrator will be prompted to verify the removal of all selected users and 
						all of their reservations. After the successful removal of users, the Manage 
						Users page will be refreshed showing that the changes have been made.<b> Deleting a 
							user will also delete ALL reservations for that user.</b></p>
					<h4>Resource Management</h4>
					<p><i>Notes:</i></p>
					<p>The initial <i>resources</i> table will be empty.</p>
					<p><i>Administrative Tool : Manage Resources</i></p>
					<p>The administrator can delete resources at any time from the system by selecting 
						the "Manage Resources" option in the Quick Links table. The "Manage Resources" 
						tool will navigate to a page listing all resources, sorted alphabetically (by 
						default), showing a specific number of resources at a time. The list of 
						resources can be sorted by ascending/descending order by column name. For each 
						column, clicking on the minus sign sorts the list in descending order based on 
						that column name, clicking on the plus sign sorts the list in ascending order 
						based on that column name. The sorting order will be preserved throughout 
						pages.</p>
					<p>To add a resource, enter the resource data into the Add Resource table at the 
						bottom of the Manage Resources page.					</p>
					<p>You will need to specify which schedule this resource belongs to. You will also 
						need to set the minimum and maximum reservation lengths. Users will not be able 
						to make reservations that are shorter than the minimum or longer than the 
						maximum. Checking the Auto-Assign Permission checkbox tells phpScheduleIt that 
						you want all users (current and future) to be given permission to use this 
						resource.</p>
					<p>Press the "Add Resource" button. The resource will be added into the database 
						with a unique identification number and the Manage Resources page will be 
						refreshed, showing the new resource. New resources will be set to "Active" by 
						default.</p>
					<p>To modify a resource's information, click on the resource's Edit link. The 
						information will appear in the form below. Any field that is changed will be 
						updated in the database. Unchanged or empty fields will not be changed in the 
						database.</p>
					<p>To delete a resource, check the Delete checkbox for each resource the 
						administrator wishes to delete and press the "Delete Resources" button. The 
						administrator will be prompted to verify the removal of the selected resources. <b>Deleting 
							a resource will also delete ALL reservations held for that resource.</b> After 
						the resources have been removed from the database, the Manage Resources page 
						will be refreshed, showing the successful removal of the resources.</p>
					<p>The status column lists each resource's <i>current</i> status. To change a 
						resource's status, simply click on the link in the "Status" column and the 
						resource will either be activated or inactivated. Resource status does NOT 
						affect previously made reservations.</p>
					<p>When adding or modifying a resource, you have the option to select the minimum 
						and maximum reservation length. Reservations less than the minimum or greater 
						than the maximum length specified will not be accepted. Setting these values to 
						the same time will require that all reservations are of this length.</p>
					<h4>Reservation Reminders</h4>
					<P>In order to enable reservation reminder emails, you must add allowed reminder 
						times to your web.config, described above, and add an automated task.</P>

					<h4>Other Admin Tools</h4>
					<p>The administrator's Quick Links table is different than all others. <i>Manage Users</i>
						and <i>Manage Resources</i> have been described already. The rest will be 
						described now. As a note, the admin tools can only be accessed by a user who 
						logs in as the administrator. All other users will be locked out of any 
						administrative page.</p>
					<p><em>Manage Schedules</em> allows you to add or edit schedules. Below is a 
						description of the schedule properties:<br>
						Schedule Title: Title of the schedule to appear in links and as a title<br>
						Day Start: Time of the day to begin allowing reservations<br>
						Day End: Time of the day to stop allowing reservations<br>
						Time Span: Reservation intervals<br>
						Week Day Start: Day of the week to start the schedule<br>
						Days To Show: Number of days to show on the schedule at a time<br>
						Reservation Offset: Number of days in advance a user needs to make a 
						reservation<br>
						Hidden: Whether the schedule can be viewed<br>
						Show Summary: Whether to show the reservation summaries<br>
						Admin Email: Email address of the administrator of this schedule</p>
					<p><i>Manage Reservations</i> will navigate to a page listing all reservations in 
						the database ordered by increasing date, showing a specific number of 
						reservations per page. The list of reservations can be sorted by 
						ascending/descending order by column name. For each column, clicking on the 
						minus sign sorts the list in descending order based on that column name, 
						clicking on the plus sign sorts the list in ascending order based on that 
						column name. The sorting order will be preserved throughout pages.</p>
					<p>In this table, clicking on the user's name will open a pop-up window with all of 
						the selected user's information. Clicking on the view, modify, delete links 
						will open a pop-up window allowing you to view, modify or delete the selected 
						reservation.</p>
					<p><em>Manage Blackout Times</em> brings you to a page set up like the online 
						scheduler, but allows you to set blackout times (times that are unavailable to 
						reserve). Setting blackout times is just like making a reservation.</p>
					<p><i> Search Scheduled Resource Usage</i> will navigate to a search form which 
						will allow the administrator to specify certain search criteria. The criteria 
						is as follows: all or any specific user, all or any specific resource, starting 
						and ending times and starting and ending dates. By default, the selected 
						starting and ending times will be the same as what is provided in the 
						configuration file and the selected starting and ending dates are the lowest 
						and highest dates currently reserved.</p>
					<p>After performing the search, the results will be printed out for each 
						user/resource combination, listed alphabetically. These results are also 
						available in a text-only format by clicking the "Print these results to a text 
						file" link at the top of the results page.</p>
					<p><em>Mass Email Users</em> will navigate to a page where you can send a mass 
						email to any or all of the registered users. This email can contain HTML tags, 
						if you wish.</p>
					<p><em>View System Stats</em> will bring you to a page where many statistics about 
						almost every aspect of the system are given. Reservation statistics are also 
						graphed out.</p>
					<h4>Notes</h4>
					<p>All database manipulation should be done though the Administration Tools, NOT 
						manually. <i>Manually editing the database can lead to data corruption and render 
							the system unstable or useless.</i></p>
